"""smforensic

A small, auditable toolbox for testing connectome-to-dynamics hypotheses under explicit,
stress-tested assumptions.

The intent is *forensic*, not predictive: the goal is to falsify fragile narratives and to
make the modeling assumptions visible and easy to perturb.

This repository accompanies the manuscript in `paper/`.
